# ELABORATED SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE: E-COMMERCE FORECASTING PLATFORM 
The proposed system is an end-to-end data-driven platform, which surmounts the 
drawbacks of single-model forecasting through its dual-engine approach: combining 
statistical rigor via SARIMAX with the accuracy of machine learning through XGBoost 
for high-fidelity predictions at scale. 
The architecture is divided into three distinct layers: the Data Ingestion Layer, the Core 
Processing Layer, and the Application & Integration Layer. 
## (1) Data Ingestion and Storage Layer 
This layer is responsible for the collection of raw historical data and its transformation 
into stable, unified datasets that are ready for model training. 
### (1a) . Data Sources 
Historical Transactional Data: Raw data from e-commerce platforms, like the Olist/ 
Kaggle dataset from order items, products, orders, and translations. 
Exogenous Variables: External inputs at prediction, including Holiday Flags and 
calendar features (such as Black Friday). 
### (1b) Data Preprocessing and Unification Module 
• Cleaning and filtering - Filters non-delivered orders and missing values (e.g., 
product categories) and duplicates. 
• Time-Series Alignment: Resamples all transaction data into a consistent Daily 
frequency, creating continuity that is important for both the SARIMAX and 
machine learning models. 
• Pivot Table Creation: This step converts the transactional data into the format 
required for the Global Model-a wide table with the index as the date and 
columns as demand for 56 categories of products. 
• Stationarity Analysis: It performs the Augmented Dickey-Fuller tests, which 
confirm whether a time series is stationary or non-stationary to allow for correct 
model parameter selection; for example, SARIMAX differencing term, d.

## 2. Core Processing and Modeling Layer 
This layer hosts the computational and intellectual core of the system, transforming the 
data into predictive features and training the dual forecasting engines. 
### (2a) Feature Engineering Engine 
This module creates the inputs to model the time dependencies and external influences 
on sales and demand. 
• AR Features / Lags: Creates lag features of (t−1,t−2,…) of target variables 
sales/demand using optimal parameters identified from preliminary analysis; for 
example, the p order in SARIMA. 
• Moving Average (MA) Features: It is used to calculate the moving mean 
statistics over predefined window sizes, for example, 2-day rolling mean, to 
model the impact of recent average demand. 
• Temporal Features: Turns date index information into separated features: 
day_of_week and month. 
• Exogenous Features: incorporates the is_holiday flag into the feature set for 
both the total sales and product demand models directly. 
## (3) Dual Forecasting Engine 
It is designed to run two different models to ensure robustness and high accuracy, using 
the XGBoost model as the main predictor.  
a) SARIMAX Baseline Model 
Purpose: to define a classic, interpretable baseline. 
Inputs: Time series data (sales) and exogenous variable - is_holiday. 
The methodology used is auto_arima identifying optimal orders (p,d,q)×(P,D,Q,s) for 
the training. 
QMSE and MAE results, for example RMSE ≈14,462. 
b) XGBoost Primary Model 
Purpose: Provide the final high-accuracy forecast. 
Inputs: Entire set of engineered features including lags, rolling means, temporal, and 
exogenous. 
Methodology: Trained as a regression model to predict the total sales target. 
Examine the results of the RMSE and MAE, for example, RMSE ≈3,303. 
## (4) Global Demand Model Architecture - Scaling Solution 
Objective: Forecast demand for more than 56 product categories using a single model 
instance. Methodology: Trains one XGBoost regressor model where the input features 
include all the engineered features for all categories, and the target is a multi-output 
vector with the demand for all 56 categories. This approach ensures scalability and low 
maintenance overhead. 3. Application and Integration Layer This layer processes the 
model outputs, converting them into actionable business intelligence for the end-user. 
### Model Evaluation and Selection Comparative Analysis: This step calculates and 
stores the final performance metrics, RMSE/MAE, of all models to validate that the 
XGBoost engine is superior in accuracy. Visualization: Creates comparison plots of 
actual versus forecast to visually confirm the performance and stability of the model. 
### Forecasting and Reporting Service Forecast Generation: The fitted XGBoost 
models are used for a multi-step-ahead forecast, like a 7-day forecast. Actionable  
insights: Outputs are translated into key business metrics. Daily Sales Projection-for 
financial planning. Product demand forecasts-for SKU-level inventory planning. 
Stockout Rate Reduction Estimates. 3.3 Business Integration (API) The final forecasts 
are delivered via an API endpoint that allows for easy integration into your existing SCM 
or ERP systems to automate inventory restocking and resource allocation.
